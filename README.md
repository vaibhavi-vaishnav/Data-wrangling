📌 Overview
This repository contains my work for Task-1 (Data Immersion & Wrangling) and Task-2 (Exploratory Data Analysis & Business Intelligence) completed as part of the ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. 60-Days Data Analytics Internship Program.
The objective of these tasks is to understand the dataset, clean it, explore it, and extract actionable insights using Python, SQL, and visualization techniques.

📘 Task-1: Data Immersion & Wrangling
🎯 Objective
Task-1 focuses on preparing the raw dataset for analysis by examining data quality, cleaning inconsistencies, and documenting metadata.
✔ Key Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset and performed initial familiarization
Checked for:
Missing values
Duplicates
Incorrect data types
Cleaned the dataset:
Filled missing values
Removed duplicates
Standardized formats
Created a Revenue field (Quantity × UnitPrice)
Built a structured Data Dictionary
Exported the cleaned dataset for Task-2

📁 Files in Task-1
task1.ipynb – Data profiling, cleaning, and documentation

cleaned_dataset.csv – Final cleaned dataset

data_dictionary.csv – Column definitions and data types

📘 Task-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Intelligence
🎯 Objective
Task-2 involves exploring the cleaned dataset through visualizations, statistical summaries, and SQL-based business questions to derive meaningful insights.
✔ Key Steps Performed
A. Descriptive Statistics
Summary of numerical and categorical features
